        Minions are small, yellow creatures who have existed since the beginning
        of time, evolving from yellow single-celled organisms into beings which
        exist only to serve history's most evil masters, but they accidentally
        end up killing all their masters—including a Tyrannosaurus, a caveman, a
        Pharaoh, and Count Dracula. They are driven into isolation after firing
        a cannon at Napoleon while in Russia and start a new life inside a cave,
        but after many years, the Minions become sad and unmotivated without a
        master to serve. To regain their dignity and serve a new one, a brave
        minion named Kevin recruits two Minions called Stuart and Bob, setting
        out to look for a new master.Minions are small, yellow creatures who
