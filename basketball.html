    <h1>Derrick Rose</h1>
    <p>
      Derrick Martell Rose (born October 4, 1988) is an American professional
      basketball player for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball
      Association (NBA). He played one year of college basketball for the
      Memphis Tigers before being drafted first overall by his hometown Chicago
      Bulls in the 2008 NBA draft.[1] He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in
      2009 and became the youngest player to win the NBA Most Valuable Player
      Award in 2011 at age 22. Rose was born and raised in Chicago, and attended
      Simeon Career Academy. He was highly recruited by colleges, eventually
      choosing to join the University of Memphis under coach John Calipari. Rose
      led the Tigers to the most wins in NCAA history (a 38–2 record), their
      first number 1 ranking in 25 years, and an appearance in the NCAA
      championship game. In 2009, an NCAA investigation revealed that Rose's SAT
      scores had been invalidated, and as a result, the NCAA vacated Memphis'
      entire 2007–08 season.[2] Rose has struggled with significant knee
      injuries since his 2010–11 MVP season. In the first round of the 2012 NBA
      playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose tore his ACL in his left
      knee. Rose required surgery and was subsequently sidelined for the entire
      2012–13 season.[3] Rose returned to play in 2013–14, but during in
      November 2013, Rose injured his right meniscus, causing him to miss the
      remainder of the season.[4] He returned once again the following season,
      but knee injuries continued to impact his availability and his production.
      In June 2016, Rose was traded to the Knicks, where he finished the final
      year of his contract. He signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers on a minimum
      salary for the 2017–18 season but was hobbled by ankle injuries, which led
      to him being traded to and subsequently waived by the Utah Jazz in
      February 2018.[5] He signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves a month later
      on a rest-of-season contract; he stayed with the team through the
      following season and enjoyed a revived role as a sixth man off the bench
      despite missing 31 games due to injury management. For the 2019–20 season,
      the Detroit Pistons signed Rose to his first non-minimum salary contract
      since 2012, and he continued to be successful off the bench.[6] The
      following season, he was reunited with his former coach Tom Thibodeau when
      the Knicks re-acquired him in a trade.
